# Cyber Security Internship – Task 1
*Name:* Gurram Baby Rani

## Objective
Perform local network port scan using Nmap and observe packet behavior with Wireshark.

## Files
- nmap_scan_results.txt — Nmap output
- wireshark_capture.pcapng — Wireshark capture (trimmed if large)
- screenshots/nmap_result.png — blurred before upload
- screenshots/wireshark_packets.png — blurred before upload

## Short steps I followed
1. Found local IP range using ipconfig/ifconfig.
2. Ran: nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24
3. Captured packets in Wireshark while scanning; saved as wireshark_capture.pcapng.
4. Added files and README to GitHub repo and published.

## Notes
- Screenshots blurred for privacy.
- PCAP trimmed/exported to keep size small.
